# Express Hotplate

An Express starter kit using npm-scripts as a build process and [PugJS](https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html) as a templating engine. :stew:

## Installation

#### Clone the repo

```
git clone git@github.com:jake-wies/express-hotplate.git
```

#### Change to directory

```
cd express-hotplate
```

```
npm install
```

## Development

Profit! All assets are served from `src` in development.

## Express

`server.js` is a pretty basic Express server. There are a few routes built into the starter kit. Change them at your leisure :blush:
